  By adding this stage, your chat universe will properly bend to the time-honored will of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Any time you throw down some RPS, the result will determine your outcome.

# 'PUBLIC', 'PRIVATE', or 'UNLISTED'.
visibility: 'PRIVATE'

# 'ADJACENT' | 'NONE' | 'COVER' | 'FULLSCREEN'
# 'ADJACENT' is default. The frame will display on the side of the
#   chat on desktop and above/in the top half of the chat on mobile.
# 'NONE' will not display, only run.
# 'COVER' will, indeed, cover the chat history completely,
#   but leave the text input box.
# 'FULLSCREEN' will make nothing below the header bar
#   show except for your stage.
position: 'NONE'

# Self-explanatory.
